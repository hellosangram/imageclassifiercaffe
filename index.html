<p>This guide is intended for people with similar laptop configurations as mine. I have an *<strong><em>Asus301U, i5 4th Gen CPU, 8gB RAM, 2gb Nvidia Graphics Card 940M, UEFI BIOS system and Ubuntu 16.04 installed as a dual-boot option.</em></strong>*<br>
Minor hiccups might come during the installation but that is the fun part to figure them out and I will leave them upto the individuals as most of them have already been resolved and just needs some digging.</p>

<a id="installation-of-cuda" class="anchor" href="#installation-of-cuda" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation of Cuda</h3>

<p>First thing to remember is that Cuda and Ubuntu versions should be inter compatible, I initially chose Cuda7.5 with Ubuntu 16.04, and it did not along well thus I had to reinstall Cuda8.0 to have it run on my machine. I will abstain from repeating the information again and thus post threads of people who have already listed the procedure.<br>
Follow this thread for Cuda installation. <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/799184/how-can-i-install-cuda-on-ubuntu-16-04">http://askubuntu.com/questions/799184/how-can-i-install-cuda-on-ubuntu-16-04</a>
Problems you might encounter and how you might resolve them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Give permission for UEFI insecure boot if required, this will allow your Nvidia Graphics card drivers to work.</li>
<li>Stop lightdm server by pressing ctr+alt+f2 and then stopping it. Go ahead finish the cuda installation and restart it.</li>
<li>Cuda sometimes install old drivers for graphics card, please update them accordingly. This is useful to resolve the issue of infinite loop login screen appearance.</li>
<li>Check Cuda version and your Graphics cards installation with standard commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow the link. <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html">http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html</a> along with <a href="http://hanzratech.in/2015/07/27/installing-caffe-on-ubuntu.html">http://hanzratech.in/2015/07/27/installing-caffe-on-ubuntu.html</a>
Remember to set your CPU and GPU flags according to your system specifications.
Don't forget to update your .bashrc file with the paths for future ease of use.
Update all the prerequisites so as to follow a smooth functioning.</p>

<p>After you install caffe, you might have some models downloaded by default in your caffe file system, if need be then download their pre-trained files too.<br>
Now for every training you have got three options to either retrain the whole network from scratch, fine tune an existing model, freeze certain layers and just modify the layers you require. Most of the time it depends on the use case on which one to adopt.</p>

<p>Link to the challenge: <a href="https://isbi-aida.grand-challenge.org/">https://isbi-aida.grand-challenge.org/</a>
My goal to complete the challenge in minimum time was the biggest critereon, this methodology should never be allowed in machine learning as each problem requires gestation before attack. I also preferred using AlexNet CNN and not any other as the images provided were of infinitesimal magnitude in comparison to ImageNet dataset which means many of the better performing models were large and prone to over-fitting.<br>
Another reason for choosing this network was due to my computer specifications which unfortunately could not support any bigger model without reducing batch size which if reduced too much might affect accuracy along with the standard affect of time.<br>
To overcome the small dataset problem I used Keras libary for data augmentation which is fabolous to use. But again too much of augmentation from the same images can not help you save from over fitting.  </p>
